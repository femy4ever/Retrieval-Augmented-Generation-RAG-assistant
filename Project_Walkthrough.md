# Personalized RAG Assistant – Project Walkthrough

This document details the development process, challenges, solutions, and future considerations for the **Personalized RAG Assistant**.

---

## Project Goal

Create a **personalized, stack-agnostic RAG assistant** for local users, capable of:

- Ingesting PDFs/TXT/MD files.
- Storing content in a **local vector database** (ChromaDB).
- Answering natural language queries using LLMs.
- Maintaining a modular architecture for future expansion.

**This implementation is a proof-of-concept using Google Gemini AI.**

---

## Development Process

### Step 1 – Planning
- Decided on **Chainlit** for the chat interface.
- Chose **ChromaDB** for a lightweight, local vector store.
- Selected **Google Gemini** for context-aware LLM generation.
- Designed modular structure:
  - `app.py` → chat logic
  - `ingest.py` → document ingestion & embeddings
  - `manage_db.py` → DB management

### Step 2 – MVP Implementation
- Implemented **PDF/TXT/MD ingestion**.
- Added **vector embeddings** using Gemini.
- Built RAG query pipeline:
  1. Retrieve relevant chunks from ChromaDB.
  2. Construct prompt for LLM.
  3. Stream LLM response to user.
- Added **interactive features**:
  - File listing, reset sliders, adjustable parameters.
- Implemented **error handling**:
  - API quota exceeded
  - File processing errors
  - DB connectivity issues

## Problems Faced & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|---------|
| API quota exceeded | Free-tier Gemini requests limit | Added friendly user message; recommend upgrade or wait until quota resets |
| `genai.Error` not found | Gemini SDK updated | Replaced with generic `Exception` handling |
| Streaming errors in Chainlit | Message.update signature mismatch | Used `stream_token()` for live streaming instead of `update()` |
| File ingestion fails silently | Bad MIME types | Added explicit file type check and error message |

---

### Possible Stacks

| Component | Current | Alternative / Scalable Option |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| LLM | Google Gemini | OpenAI, Anthropic, Local LLaMA / Mistral models |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB | FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate |
| Chat Interface | Chainlit | Streamlit, Gradio, Custom Web App |
| Storage | Local | Cloud Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) |

---

### Current vs Alternative

#### Current Free-tier vs Paid Tier

| Component | Free Tier | Paid Tier / Pricing | Notes / Scaling |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **LLM Model** | Gemini AI: 50 requests/day per model | Gemini Paid: Higher quota (check Google Cloud pricing) | Can switch to OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models for unlimited or cheaper usage |
| **Vector DB** | ChromaDB local: free | Cloud DBs: Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate | Scales horizontally; supports millions of vectors |
| **Chat Interface** | Chainlit: free | Streamlit / Gradio / Custom Web App | Can deploy web app publicly; Chainlit works locally for MVP |
| **Storage** | Local file system | Cloud storage: S3, GCS, Azure Blob | Required if documents grow or multi-user support needed |
| **Embedding Model** | Gemini embeddings: free with LLM | Paid LLM embeddings or OpenAI embeddings | Faster retrieval with specialized embedding models |

---

#### Free-tier vs Paid Options

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Tier / Pricing |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Google Gemini | 50 requests/day per model | Paid plan: higher quota per project |
| OpenAI GPT | 3k tokens/month free | Pay-as-you-go: ~$0.03 per 1k tokens (GPT-4) |
| ChromaDB | Free, local | Cloud-hosted solutions for scaling |
| Pinecone | Free 5M vectors | Pay-as-you-go scaling, ~$0.10 per 100k vectors/month |
| Milvus | Open source | Cloud-managed via Zilliz Cloud (~$50/month for medium workload) |

---

## Future Enhancements

- Support **multiple LLMs** and dynamic model switching.
- Multi-modal ingestion: PDFs, DOCX, images, audio.
- Contextual memory for sessions and user personalization.
- Role-based and multi-user chat sessions.
- Integration with free-tier LLMs to avoid cost limits.
- Metrics dashboard for usage, quota, and vector DB stats.

---

## Lessons Learned

- API quotas can silently break user experience; handling with clear messaging is essential.
- Chainlit streaming requires `stream_token()` instead of updating messages mid-stream.
- Local vector DBs like ChromaDB are fast and easy for MVPs but require cloud options for scaling.
- Modular architecture simplifies migration to different LLMs and vector stores.

---

## Project Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **working, personalized RAG assistant MVP** with Gemini AI.  
It validates the core **ingestion → embedding → retrieval → generation** flow, while remaining modular for expansion into a **fully agnostic, scalable RAG system**.

### Scaling Recommendations

1. **Switch to a multi-LLM architecture**:
   - Allows fallback if one model’s quota is exceeded.
   - Supports open-source LLMs for cost reduction.
2. **Move vector DB to managed cloud**:
   - Ensures high availability.
   - Enables multi-user concurrent access.
3. **Multi-modal support**:
   - Add DOCX, images, and audio ingestion.
4. **Quota-aware user handling**:
   - Track usage per user.
   - Display remaining free-tier requests.
5. **Professional Deployment**:
   - Containerize app (Docker) for easy deployment.
   - Use CI/CD for automated testing and model updates.
6. **Analytics & Logging**:
   - Track embeddings, retrieval speed, and API response times.
   - Optimize chunk size, vector DB indexing, and streaming performance.

### Summary

This table and diagram help stakeholders quickly understand:

- Which components are **free-tier** vs **paid**.
- Where **bottlenecks** or quota limits might appear.
- How the system can **scale** for more users, documents, and larger LLMs.
